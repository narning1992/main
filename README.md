I'm a D.Phil candidate enrolled in the Interdisciplinary Biosciences DTP at the University of Oxford and currently working in the field of computational genomics. I have so far worked with eukaryotic, viral and bacterial genomes. In my work I combine my knowledge from genomics, programming, machine learning and applied statistics to make sense of the wealth of big data in bioinformatics.

I use Python, and C if necessary, to adjust input and output for existing tools and develop standalone programs myself. I implement and combine own scripts with existing programs in Bash to form streamlined pipelines which can be run on clusters via Sun Gridengine. Pipelines and their output are accompanied with statistics, manuals, reports and work-flows generated by R, Matlab, Inkscape and LaTeX.

Currently I am working for the Daniel Wilson group on topics related to the evolutionary trajectory of Bacterie in deep time. A side project is also Machine learning applications in the source attribution of Campylobacteriosis. This is where I publish my scripts.
